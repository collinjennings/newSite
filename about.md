Hello! I'm a Mellon Postdoctoral Fellow in Experimental Humanities at Bard, and I received my Ph.D. in English and American Literature from New York University. My work uses computational methods to explore lexical and syntactic patterns in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century literary genres that experimented with new forms of arrangement. I'm interested in exploring how patterns observed from computational analyses of literature and other cultural forms can be read in relation to older approaches to organizing cultural knowledge that emerged in different medial paradigms.
