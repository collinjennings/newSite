# Critical Potluck Rules

We take:

1. an **object**, which typically is some kind of data that we can interrogate from different perspectives, represented in the various disciplinary and personal backgrounds contributed by the participants. 

2. a **group** of faculty and students with different experience and expertise bring their critical skills to share
a challenge. 

3. a **period** to answer the challenge in a stimulating and revelatory way. Our typical collaborations last between 90 minutes and two hours.
