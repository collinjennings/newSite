Here's is where I have organized all of the code and corpora that I used in producing the computational analyses found in my book, _Enlightenment Links: Theories of Mind and Media in Eighteenth-Century Britain_ (Stanford University Press, 2024). All of the code is organized in Jupyter notebooks. Feel free to contact me at collin [dot] jennings [at] gmail [dot] com if you have any questions or feedback. Thanks!
